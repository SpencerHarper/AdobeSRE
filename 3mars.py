# #3 â€“ Implement an LRU Cache
# Implement a web app that uses a fixed-size LRU cache to efficiently serve up imagery
# The app exposes a web API that accepts two floats, the first in the range -90 to 90 (Lat) and
# the second in the range of -180 to 180 (Long), which are Mars coordinates. The app returns
# the URL of an image file of those coordinates on the Martian surface, or one of the standard
# HTTP error codes.
# This app implements an LRU cache of fixed size (3000), keyed on Lat/Long pairs, which
# operates in O(1) to return the requested URL. New URLs are obtained using a library
# function GetImageURL(float, float), which returnas instantaneously but at a high $ cost;
# implement a stub version of GetImageURL() that returns a random number as a string for
# purposes of this problem.
# On a cache hit, the app returns the cached URL. On a cache miss, the app obtains a new
# URL and caches it, ejecting the oldest cached item if the cache is full. These operations
# must occur in O(1).
# Bonus points for adding diagnostic API calls to get and clear cache hit and miss counters,
# and to track the execution time of each of the three main LRU cache behaviors (hit, miss
# when not full, miss when full).
